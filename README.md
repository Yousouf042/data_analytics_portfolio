### 1. Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis

![Dashboard Preview](assets/superstore_sales_analysis_overview.png)

**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI  
**Description:**  
Analyzed a retail Superstore dataset to uncover the key drivers of profit and loss across product categories, regions, customer segments, and shipping methods. The project focused on understanding why high sales volumes did not always translate into profitability and identifying underperforming product–region combinations.

**Key Tasks:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, data types, feature creation such as profit margin)

- Exploratory data analysis using Python

- Correlation and interaction analysis (discount vs profit margin, category vs region)

- KPI development (Sales, Profit, Profit Margin)

- Interactive dashboard design in Power BI with drill-through and storytelling layout

**Insights:**
- Furniture recorded high sales but low profitability (≈2.5% profit margin), making it the weakest category overall

- States such as Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Florida generated high sales but significant losses

- Tables and Bookcases were the major loss-driving subcategories, while Copiers, Phones, Accessories, and Paper were the top profit contributors

- A strong negative relationship was found between Discount and Profit Margin (correlation ≈ -0.86)

- Ship Mode and Customer Segment showed no significant impact on overall profitability

- The Central and Southern regions underperformed compared to the West, which achieved the highest profitability, especially in Office Supplies
